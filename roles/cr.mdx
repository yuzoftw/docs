# What are custom roles? 
Custom roles allow you to create your own commands that automatically assign designated roles to users. This makes role management faster and more efficient.

# Setting up custom roles

<Tip>
Itâ€™s recommended to use custom commands like `staff` and `admin` to assign roles, rather than giving them manually. This approach keeps role management easie & more consistent.
