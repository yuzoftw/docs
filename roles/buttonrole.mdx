# What are button roles?
Button roles are roles assigned to members when they click a button on a message or embed. They are useful for letting members self-assign unique roles or verify themselves easily.

# Create a button role

You can add a button role by using the `buttonrole add` command.

<Tip>
You can create multiple button roles for a single message.
</Tip>
<Info>
Button roles can only be added to messages or embeds sent by nyixe. Learn how to create an embed [here](https://nyxie.mintlify.app/resources/embeds)!
