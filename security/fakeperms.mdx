## Why Use Fake Permissions?
Fake permissions act as a safeguard against rogue moderators or compromised accounts running malicious scripts that could spam the **Discord API** and perform destructive actions like mass banning members. This method adds a strong layer of protection, making it virtually impossible for your server to be nuked or severely damaged.

## How do fake permissions work?
When a moderator is given fake permissions, such as ban from the select menu, they will be able to use the ban command with bleed, but they wonâ€™t be able to use the native Discord ban feature.

## Getting command permissions
You can locate the required permissions for a command with `?help (command)`.
