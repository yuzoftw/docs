# Overview
Moderation commands require some basic setup before they can be used. This includes **moderation logs** and the **jailed role & channel**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating the case logs & jail role">
    <Info>
    Jail is a feature similar to mute, but it restricts users from all channels except #jail.
    </Info>
    Use the `?setup` command to create the case logs channel and jail role.

</Steps>

Upon completion of the setup, you’ll notice a few new roles and channels in your server.

- **Jailed** - Used to restrict users from all channels except the `#jail` channel.
  - The jailed role cannot be renamed since it’s found by its name.
